      <p className="mb-3 text-justify">
        1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><strong>Purpose</strong></u>. This Agreement provides for the transfer of all ownership rights in the Client&apos;s designated dog(s) to Encore upon the Client&apos;s death and for the ongoing care or placement of such dog(s) by Encore. This Agreement is not an insurance policy or trust and is not intended to constitute either.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3 text-justify pl-6">
        The Client acknowledges that Texas law (Texas Property Code §112.037) expressly permits the creation of pet trusts for the care of animals. While this Agreement is not a formal trust, the parties intend for it to serve a similar purpose as a legally enforceable arrangement for pet care after the Client&apos;s death. The Client has the option to provide for the pet in their Will or through a pet trust; however, such measures (or lack thereof) shall not affect the validity of this Agreement. This Agreement shall be interpreted, to the extent possible, in a manner consistent with Texas Estates Code §254.004 regarding contracts to make a will or devise.
      </p>

      {/* Dogs Covered */}

        <p className="pl-6 text-justify">
          a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><strong>Identification and Records</strong></u>. The Client will, upon request, provide Encore with copies of veterinary records, microchip information, and any registration or pedigree papers for the dog(s) to facilitate future care and placement. The Client consents that upon transfer of the dog(s) to Encore, any microchip registration will be updated to list Encore (or any subsequent adopter) as the primary contact. The Client&apos;s estate or Designated Representative shall also transfer any remaining pet medications, special diets, or necessary items to Encore along with the dog.
        </p>
        <p className="pl-6 text-justify">
          b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><strong>Adding Additional Dog(s)</strong></u>. If the Client acquires one or more additional dog(s) during the term of this Agreement and wishes to include them under its terms, the Client shall notify Encore in writing and provide the required information. Encore reserves the right to approve or deny the inclusion of the new dog(s). If approved, the parties shall execute a written addendum and adjust any fees accordingly. If not approved, the Agreement shall remain in force only for the previously covered dog(s).

        <p className="pl-6 text-justify">
          c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><strong>Death or Permanent Loss of Dog(s)</strong></u>. If any dog listed in this Agreement or its Appendix A dies, is permanently lost, or is lawfully transferred to another owner prior to the Client&apos;s death, the Client (or their Designated Representative) shall promptly notify Encore in writing.

Encore shall have the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to reject any proposed Designated Representative and to require the Client to appoint a substitute Designated Representative acceptable to Encore. The Client acknowledges and agrees that the appointment and cooperation of a Designated Representative satisfactory to Encore is a material condition to Encore&apos;s obligations under this Agreement. Encore shall not be liable for any delay or failure in assuming ownership of the dog(s) resulting from any failure or delay by the Designated Representative or from any deficiencies in the information or cooperation provided.
        </p>
        <p className="pl-6 text-justify">

This includes providing appropriate nutrition, water, shelter, exercise, socialization, and veterinary care (including prompt medical attention for any illness or injury). The dog(s) will be housed in safe, clean, and secure facilities, with separation by compatibility as needed, and will receive affection and humane treatment for the duration of their stay.

Any individual or organization assuming guardianship of the dog(s) through Encore will be required to sign an agreement to provide proper care and to return the animal to Encore if they are unable to continue care. Encore will conduct due diligence in screening potential adopters or placements, which may include reference checks, home visits, and veterinary checks as applicable, to ensure the welfare of the dog(s). If no suitable home is found immediately, the dog(s) will remain in the care of Encore or an Encore-affiliated sanctuary or foster home, and the Client&apos;s dog(s) will <strong>not</strong> be euthanized for lack of space or inconvenience (euthanasia will only be considered in accordance with the End-of-Life Care clause for health and welfare reasons).

If Encore exercises its right to nullify this Agreement, all Encore obligations shall immediately and permanently cease. Encore shall not be required to transport, house, adopt, or care for the dog(s) under any circumstances.

      <p className="mb-3 text-justify">
        13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><strong>Force Majeure</strong></u>. &quot;Force Majeure&quot; refers to any event outside a party&apos;s reasonable control that materially prevents or delays performance, including natural disasters (e.g., floods, hurricanes, wildfires), war, terrorism, civil unrest, epidemics, pandemics, government actions, power or transportation failures, or similar events. If Force Majeure temporarily prevents a party from fulfilling obligations, then performance is suspended only for the duration of the delay. The affected party must promptly notify the other party in writing and resume performance as soon as reasonably possible. If Force Majeure lasts for more than sixty (60) consecutive days and significantly hinders Encore from accepting or caring for the dog(s), Encore may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the Client (or, if deceased, the Designated Representative or estate). Encore will be released from further obligations, and the Client (or estate) waives any claims against Encore for non-performance due to Force Majeure. Force Majeure does not excuse any payment obligations or other liabilities that arose before the event.

        14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u><strong>Operational Inability to Perform</strong></u>. Encore&apos;s obligations under this Agreement are conditional upon its continued ability to accept and care for the Client&apos;s dog(s) at the time of the Client&apos;s death. While Encore intends in good faith to fulfill this Agreement, its performance may be excused if, despite reasonable efforts, Encore cannot accept custody of the dog(s) due to closure, insolvency, a lack of facilities or foster resources, or other substantial limitations beyond Encore&apos;s control that are not covered by Force Majeure. In such cases, Encore may, but is not obligated to, refer the dog(s) to or transfer this Agreement to a qualified third party, such as a licensed rescue, animal sanctuary, or affiliated care provider able to assume custody in accordance with this Agreement&apos;s intent. Any such assignment shall be promptly communicated to the Client&apos;s estate or Designated Representative. If Encore determines that it cannot reasonably perform and no suitable assignment is possible, Encore is released from further obligations under this Agreement. The Client waives any claims against Encore for such non-performance and acknowledges that all payments under this Agreement are non-refundable.

This Agreement does not provide for the payment of money or benefits to the Client, the Client&apos;s estate, or any third party upon the Client&apos;s death. Instead, the Agreement specifies the performance of services by Encore, which is conditional upon certain factual circumstances, including the continued operation and capacity of Encore and the timely payment of service fees by the Client during their lifetime.
